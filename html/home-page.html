        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is a simple Electron based application that is 
            used to try to learn how to use JS, HTML, and CSS to
            create a simple application.
        </p>
        <h2>How can I use it?</h2>
        <p>You can see on the left hand side of the screen that there
            are two buttons. One of them is the "Home Page" button and
            the other is the "Hello World Page" button. You can click
            on these buttons to navigate between the two pages.
